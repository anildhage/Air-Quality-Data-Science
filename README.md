## Overview
Air Quality Prediction. Here we implement a data science project from scratch. Based on the historical climate data, a various cmachine learning models are created in this project that will predict the quality of air. This project will help you understand the complete process behind how a data turned into a model which will then be used to predict future climatic conditions. 

## Motivation
During the pandemic that happened in 2020, I was not able to work and do anything. Due to the personal situations I couldn't build my career like search a job and work at one. Hence, I started learning about programming and taught code to myself. To get started I chose python programming and found data science as an interesting topic to me. Then began my journey to real build projects, so that once I am sorted, I would be able to get a job and grow my career in this industry as a Data Scientist.
